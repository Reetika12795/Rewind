description = """
This image shows a stunning coastal view of a Mediterranean city, likely Nice on the French Riviera. The scene features:

A wide, curving bay with striking turquoise and deep blue waters transitioning beautifully from the shoreline outward.

A long pebble beach with scattered people relaxing, sunbathing, and strolling near the surf.

Palm-lined promenades running parallel to the shore, adding a tropical feel.

A wide coastal road with smooth curves following the bay, flanked by pedestrian and cycling lanes.

A cityscape in the background, with mid-rise buildings painted in warm tones (yellows, reds, and creams), stretching up into the hills.

Clear blue skies that suggest warm, sunny weather.

Itâ€™s a postcard-perfect scene capturing both the relaxing beach atmosphere and the vibrant urban energy of the French Riviera."""
